# hello-world
Description: A repository is used to organize a single project. Can contain folders, files, videos, etc. Anything the project needs.
I like notebooks and I need lots of them to keep track of my stuff. I probably need new notebooks for GitHub, Python, SQL, and who knows what else. I need one for each of them!

I really am going to need a lot of them. Probably lots of colors too. Good stuff.

Adios,
